## Usage Guide

1. **Start the app** — Launch the app and navigate to the home screen.
2. **Create or join a session** — Generate a new room or enter an existing Room ID.
3. **Collaborate in real-time** — Invite peers; everyone sees each other’s cursors and edits instantly.
4. **Save progress** — Your code persists between sessions (if persistence is configured).
5. **Leave the session** — When done, exit or close the browser; others may continue editing.

* Language-specific formatting and code intelligence (linting, autocomplete)
* Editor themes (light, dark mode)
* Docker deployment or Vercel/Netlify support
* Recording playback and version history
